<p>Apple has finally revealed all regarding the Apple Watch, the wrist-based wearable it first introduced last September. Many of the Apple Watch’s particulars were already known, but here, for the first time, is a comprehensive look at what will no doubt become the world’s most popular smartwatch.</p>
<p>Take a call from the trail. Check in with a buddy over Walkie-Talkie. Keep your workouts going by streaming Apple Music. Or raise your wrist and ask Siri to order your usual. Apple Watch Series 4 with cellular makes it easy to stay connected to the people and information you care about most. Even when you don’t have your phone.</p>
<p>Emergency SOS calls for help when you can’t. It dials 911, notifies your emergency contacts, sends your current location, and displays your Medical ID badge on the screen for emergency personnel. And Apple Watch Series 4 with cellular does it all even when you’re away from your phone.</p>
<p>Quicker than a call. More personal than a text. The Walkie-Talkie app lets you communicate in a fun way with anyone who has an Apple Watch. Just press to talk. Let go to listen. Roger that?</p>
